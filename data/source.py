They'll help your doctor see if you have signs of heart trouble and figure out the best treatment for you. Blood pressure check. It's a painless test that uses a special meter to measure the force of blood pushing against your vessel walls. If you don't get your high blood pressure under control, you could get health problems like: Stroke Heart attack Heart failure Kidney failure Carotid ultrasound. It uses high-frequency sound waves to give your doctor a view of your major neck arteries, called the carotids. He'll be able to see if you have any narrowing of your arteries that's caused by a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque. Computerized tomography ( CT) of the heart and calcium scores. This imaging test can spot calcium deposits in vessels on your heart. More calcium means more coronary atherosclerosis -- a hardening and narrowing of your arteries. Your doctor uses the test results to figure out your odds of having heart trouble. Electrocardiogram ( EKG). It's a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Your doctor will be able to check for things like: Heart rhythms that aren't normal A larger-than-usual heart chamber Poor blood flow Heart attack Ambulatory electrocardiogram ( Holter monitor). This test measures the electrical activity of your heart while you go about your regular daily activities. Echocardiograph (echo). It uses ultrasound to give your doctor a graphic outline of your heart chambers and their movement. He'll be able to check your heart's structure and motion, and see how thick the heart muscle is and how well the heart pumps. Exercise stress test. It's a treadmill test that helps your doctor find out how much blood flow gets to your heart muscle when it works hard, like while you exercise. You'll learn if you have less blood flow in the arteries that send blood to your heart muscle. Your doctor can use this info to figure out what a safe level of exercise is for you. Coronary angiography. This procedure, also known as cardiac catheterization, can help your doctor check how many artery blockages you have and how severe they are."

        "context": "Men need a lot of different body parts working the right way -- from the brain and glands that control hormones to blood vessels and the penis -- to get and keep an erection. Because of that, erectile dysfunction, or ED, can have a lot of causes. Some of them are physical; others are mental and emotional. Physical reasons for ED range from heart disease and diabetes to high blood pressure and obesity. Damage to your nerves or arteries can cause problems with erections, too. Lack of exercise, drinking, and smoking can lead to problems. On the mental and emotional side of things, anxiety, depression, and stress all play a role. Relationship issues can also be a factor. With so many possible causes, your doctor has a number of tests he can use to figure out the best treatment for you. This one's not actually a test, but your doctor will likely start with questions about your medical and sexual history. The reason is simple: He wants to better understand how ED affects you and see whether there might be a clear cause for it. When you talk about past surgeries, medicine you take, injuries, and lifestyle choices, your doctor can learn about diseases or other issues you might have that might lead to ED. By asking about your sexual history -- your relationships, sex drive, if you ever get erections -- he can begin to figure out whether the problem is more likely to be physical or mental. Be honest with your doctor; he can't help you if you withhold information. Your doctor will check your penis and testicles to make sure they look normal and their nerves work as expected. He may also look for hair loss and larger-than-normal breasts. Both of these can be signs that you have a hormone problem. He may also: Check your pulse at your wrists and ankles to see whether your blood flow is normal Listen to your heartbeat to make sure it sounds right Take your blood pressure Based on your physical exam as well as your medical and sexual history, your doctor may want to order certain blood or urine tests. He'll use these to check for problems that can lead to ED, such as: Diabetes Heart disease Kidney disease Hormonal problems such as low testosterone One type of blood test can check your thyroid function. A butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, it has a lot of jobs to do. One of them is to help with the flow of sex hormones. This test can check whether it's working right. Usually, men have 3 to 5 erections during the night as they sleep. Your doctor may use an overnight erection test to see whether you're able to get an erection. For this test, you will place a device around your penis before you go to sleep. It measures how many erections you have and how strong they are. A simpler version of this test uses a special plastic ring around your penis. If you get an erection, the ring breaks. If the test shows that you can get erections, it's more likely that the ED is caused by something mental or emotional. An injection test is also called an intracavernosal test. Your doctor injects a medicine into the base of your penis that should give you an erection. If you don't get one, you may have a problem with blood flow to your penis. Sometimes called Doppler ultrasound, this is another way to check blood flow to the penis. It may be used along with the injection test. Your doctor takes a device that looks like a wand and holds it over your penis. It uses sound waves to create a video of your blood vessels so your doctor can look at blood flow. If it looks more likely that a mental or emotional issue is the source of the problem, your doctor will ask you standard questions about your mental well-being. They help him check for depression, anxiety, and other common causes of erectile dysfunction. If you have a regular sexual partner, your doctor may ask to talk to the two of you together. This can help him learn more about your relationship and how it might affect your ability to get and keep erections."

        "context": "We all know that our weight plays a big role in our health. Of course, other things -- like how active you are, your waist size, and what conditions run in your family -- also matter a lot. Still, certain conditions are strongly linked to, or even caused by, obesity. That's the word that doctors use if your BMI, or body mass index, is 30 or higher. If that's you, remember that you can start to turn things around if you lose even a small amount of weight. Where you are today is just the beginning. Even if you've tried before to lose the weight, or lost weight and gained it back, your future health is in your hands. With work and support, you can cut your chances of getting these weight-related conditions. A sticky substance called plaque can build up inside your arteries, which are the vessels that carry blood away from your heart. Too much plaque can narrow and eventually block your arteries. This can lead to a heart attack or heart failure. But there are a lot of things you can do to prevent that. It starts with a simple blood test to check your cholesterol levels. If you have too much \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad\u00e2\u0080\u009d cholesterol, or LDL, you can change your diet. You can eat less saturated fat (found in animal foods), and more fiber (from plant foods), for instance. Becoming more active will help, too. If that's not enough, you may also need to take medicines to help turn things around. As your heart beats, it pumps blood through the walls of your arteries. This creates a force, or pressure. If this pressure is too high and goes unchecked for too long, it can damage other organs, such as your kidneys or brain. High blood pressure is more likely if you're overweight or obese. But it also can change, for the better, as you start to take the weight off. Remember the plaque that built up in your arteries? It can break loose and act as a blood clot, or embolus. As it travels through your bloodstream, it can cause other problems. If it lands in an artery in your heart, that's a heart attack. If it gets too close to your brain, it can block the flow of oxygen. After just a few minutes without oxygen, brain cells begin to die, causing a stroke. The same things that help lower your chances of heart disease are also going to make a stroke less likely. People over 40 who are overweight are most at risk for this disease. But younger people -- even kids and teens -- also get it, and extra pounds make it more likely. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body's blood sugar level is too high. It doesn't handle insulin like it should. Over time, your body starts to resist insulin or can't make enough of it to control your blood sugar levels. If your blood sugar stays too high for too long, you could get other things, like blindness, infections, and chronic kidney failure. You'll want to check with your doctor to find out if your blood sugar level is in the normal range. If you find out that you have prediabetes or diabetes, you'll want to start treatment right away. You might need to take medicine for it, but if you can lose enough weight through diet and exercise, you may be able to cut back on, or even stop, those medications. This is a combination of conditions that put you at risk for other problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or stroke. For example, you might be overweight, especially around your waistline, and have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, as well as cholesterol problems. A checkup can tell you if you're at risk. One simple thing you can do is to use a tape measure to check your waist. If it's more than 35 inches for women, or more than 40 inches for men, you're more likely to have weight-related health problems. There's a link between obesity and certain cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and cancers of the kidney, pancreas, and thyroid. Scientists aren't sure if being overweight actually causes cancer. But they do know that fat feeds the growth of existing cancer cells. Of course, people who aren't overweight can get cancer, too. So just like anyone else, it's important for you to keep up with any cancer tests that your doctor recommends. You develop this type of arthritis after the tissue that cushions your bones, called cartilage, wears down as you age. Osteoarthritis is painful and most often affects your spine, knees, hands, and hips. If you're overweight, the extra pounds put more pressure on your weight-bearing joints. Fat also makes proteins that can cause inflammation. As you start to lose weight, you'll feel and move better, and your joints will have less stress. When you have this sleep disorder, the muscles in the back of your throat can't keep your throat open while you're asleep. This makes you stop breathing for seconds at a time. When you're overweight, extra fat around your neck could narrow your airway and also affect your breathing. You might not know that this is happening. If you feel tired a lot and don't feel more rested after you try simple things like going to bed earlier, tell your doctor. She may send you to a specialist to find out if you have sleep apnea. If you do, there are treatments. And again, it could get better as you lose weight. Your gallbladder produces bile, a fluid that helps break down the food you eat. Sometimes if there is too much cholesterol in your bile it can harden and form painful \u00e2\u0080\u009cstones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Doctors aren't sure why, but they do know that if you're overweight or obese, you're more likely to get gallstones. They may become a thing of your past as you work toward a new size. Women who are overweight may have irregular periods or skip ovulation. Men might get ED, or erectile dysfunction, or their semen quality might not be as good as it could be. If you're a woman who's been trying to get pregnant and it's not happening, it's a good idea to see a doctor. There could be many causes, but if it's your weight, that's something that you can start to change. Men with ED may find that as they get healthier overall, these problems go away. Just as with many of the other conditions on this list, change is possible."

        "context": "A kidney stone can be as tiny as a grain of sand, and you can pass it in your pee without ever knowing. But a bigger one can block your urine flow and hurt a lot. Some people say the pain can be worse than childbirth. These hard nuggets form when minerals in your pee clump together. That can happen from many things, like what you eat and certain medications. If you or someone in your family has had a kidney stone, you're more likely to have one in the future. You need to make enough urine to dilute the things that can turn into stones. If you don't drink enough or sweat too much, your pee may look dark. It should be pale yellow or clear. If you've had a stone before, you should make about 8 cups of urine a day. So aim to down about 10 cups daily, since you lose some fluids through sweat and breathing. Swap a glass of water for a citrus drink. The citrate in lemonade or orange juice can block stones from forming. What you eat can play a big role in whether you get one of these stones. The most common type of kidney stone happens when calcium and oxalate stick together when your kidneys make urine. Oxalate is a chemical that's in many healthy foods and vegetables. Your doctor may tell you to limit high-oxalate foods if you've had this type of stone before. Examples include: Spinach Rhubarb Grits Bran cereal You may have heard that drinking milk can bring on kidney stones. That's not true. If you eat or drink calcium-rich foods (like milk and cheese) and foods with oxalate at the same time, it helps your body better handle the oxalate. That's because the two tend to bind in the gut instead of in the kidneys, where a stone can form. Sodium. You mainly get this through table salt. It can raise your chances of getting several types of kidney stones. So watch out for salty snacks, canned foods, packaged meats, and other processed foods. Animal protein. Another kind of kidney stone forms when your pee is too acidic. Red meat and shellfish can make uric acid in your body rise. This can collect in the joints and cause gout or go to your kidneys and make a stone. More importantly, animal protein raises your urine's calcium level and lowers the amount of citrate, both of which encourage stones. Stones are the most common kidney problem in people with inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Bowel problems can give you diarrhea, so you make less pee. Your body may absorb extra oxalate from the intestine, so more gets in your urine. You're almost twice as likely to get a kidney stone if you're obese. That's when your body mass index is 30 or above. If you're 5 feet 10 inches tall, obesity starts at 210 pounds. Weight loss surgery can help you shed pounds and improve your health. But studies suggest that people who have the most common weight loss operation, the Roux-en- Y gastric bypass, have an increased risk of stones. Not every weight loss surgery carries this risk. Only the ones that cause malabsorption.. Many diseases can encourage one or more types of kidney stones to form. Certain genetic diseases. One example is medullary sponge kidney, a birth defect that causes cysts to form in the kidneys. Type 2 diabetes . It can make your urine more acidic, which encourages stones. Gout . This condition makes uric acid build up in the blood and form crystals in the joints and the kidneys. The kidney stones can become large and very painful. Hyperparathyroidism. Your parathyroid glands can pump out too much hormones, which raises calcium levels in your blood and urine. Renal tubular acidosis. This kidney problem causes too much acid to build up in the body. Some that can cause stones include: Certain antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and sulfa antibiotics Some drugs to treat HIV and AIDS Certain diuretics used to treat high blood pressure. But some thiazide-type diuretics actually help prevent stones."

Pressure readings help your doctor diagnose and keep track of glaucoma. He'll give you drops to numb your eye, then press lightly on it with a tool called a tonometer. This computerized test maps the curve of your cornea. It can show problems with your eye's surface, like swelling or scarring, or conditions such as astigmatism. You might have it before you have surgery, a cornea transplant, or a contact lens fitting. This lets the doctor see how well blood moves in your retina. It helps diagnose diabetic retinopathy, retina detachment, and macular degeneration. The doctor will inject a special dye, called fluorescein, into a vein in your arm. It travels quickly to blood vessels inside your eye. Once it gets there, the doctor uses a camera with special filters to highlight the dye. He takes pictures of the dye as it goes though the blood vessels in the back of your eye. This helps him spot circulation problems, swelling, leaking, or abnormal blood vessels. The doctor uses special drops to expand your eye's pupil (he'll call this dilate). That lets him check your retina for signs of disease. This is what the doctor uses to get your eyeglasses prescription. You look at a chart, usually 20 feet away, or in a mirror that makes things look like they're 20 feet away. You'll look through a tool called a phoropter. It lets the doctor move lenses of different strengths in front of your eyes. You can tell him if things look clear or blurry. Your answers give him your prescription for your glasses or contact lenses. The test will also help him spot presbyopia, hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism. The doctor uses this microscope to shine a beam of light shaped like a small slit on your eye. He may also dilate your pupils during the test. It can help diagnose cataracts, glaucoma, detached retina, macular degeneration, cornea injuries, and dry eye disease. This test helps diagnose glaucoma. The doctor will use a tool called a tonometer that blows a tiny puff of air, measuring eye pressure indirectly by the eye's resistance to the puff. Applanation instruments can also measure pressure. They are the most accurate, but you'll need local anesthetic. This computerized test can give a remarkably detailed image of the retina and all of its layers. You might get it if you have a serious retina condition, like age-related macular degeneration or retinal detachment. This test uses sound waves to make picture of the inside of your eye. It helps your doctor diagnose and treat tumors, cataracts, or bleeding in your eye. You might also get it before cataract surgery. This measures how well you see at near and far distances. If your child can't yet read, the doctor will use a special test. Your child will look at a letter \" E\" then tell the doctor the way the legs point with her fingers. You can practice this at home before the test. This measures your peripheral (side) vision. You'll stare at on object in the center of your line of vision (like the doctor's eyes or a computer screen). As you look at the target, you'll note when you see an object moving into your field of vision or, depending on the test, when the lighted spot appears . This test lets the doctor know if conditions like stroke or glaucoma have hurt your vision."

This noninvasive procedure freezes and kills fat cells. Once they're dead, your body naturally removes them. This treatment is usually used for body shaping, but fat removal can also improve your cellulite. It can take three treatments and 3 or 4 months for you to see results. Also called radiofrequency systems, they show promise for cellulite. Treatment usually mixes massage, liposuction, or light therapy. It can liquefy fat, cut connective tissue to loosen puckering, boost collagen growth and skin tightening, increase blood flow, and lessen fluid retention. Expect results to last at least 6 months. One popular FDA-approved laser treatment is called Cellulaze. The doctor injects numbing solution into the area, then puts a laser under your skin. It shoots heat in three directions. You can expect about a 75% improvement in your cellulite for about a year. Most options are based on the idea that massaging the problem area will increase blood flow and reduce fluid buildup. The result: Better-looking hips and buttocks. Endermologie (or lipomassage or endermology) is a specific type of mechanical massage. A machine with low-pressure suction kneads your skin between two spinning rollers. The theory is that the deep massage will break up the connective tissue that causes dimples. Most studies show that massage techniques, including endermologie, make your skin look better for a short time but offer no long-term benefit. Some experts worry that the suction can cause your skin to slacken prematurely, making it look worse. This is a low-energy version of the technology that treats kidney stones. It's a noninvasive treatment that's given twice a week for 6 or more weeks. It could give results for 2 to 6 months, but more research about how well it works and how long results may last is needed. People of all sizes can have cellulite. But if you're overweight, the most effective treatment is to shed extra pounds and tone your body. Eat less and add more cardio and strength training exercise. Lift weights at least 2 days a week. Focus on your legs, hips, and backside. Strong, defined muscles under a thinner fat layer will make your skin smoother and less puckered. This minimally invasive procedure can improve your cellulite. Results have been shown to last for at least 2 years. The doctor marks the area, injects a numbing solution, and then inserts a tiny blade to cut the connective tissue that holds your fat onto those dimples. A hand-held device called Cellfina was approved in 2015 to make this procedure more precise. It provides vacuum-assisted control of the depth and area treated. About 20 to 30 individual cellulite dimples are treated during an average 1-hour session. Results can last up to 2 years. A variety of creams on the market claim to reduce cellulite. Many have ingredients intended to promote fat breakdown (caffeine, aminophylline, theophylline). Others contain vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. Generally, these products offer little benefit alone, but they may add some value when combined with other treatments. Some evidence suggests that retinol cream can help with cellulite, but the results aren't great. Twice-daily application of a 0.3% retinol cream for 6 months can thicken your skin and reduce that orange-peel look. Injectables. Some doctors inject chemicals into the fat layer below the skin to encourage breakdown and make cellulite less noticeable. This procedure is often called mesotherapy. The chemicals used include phosphatidylcholine, aminophylline, hormones, herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals. There's little proof these treatments help. Most doctors don't recommend the procedure because there's a risk of infection, swelling, rashes, and lumpy skin. Liposuction.

        "context": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) can make school a struggle. Problems with listening, following directions, and self-control can be roadblocks to learning. To help your child, work hand-in-hand with his teachers Working as a team helps. It shows your child that the most important adults in his life have his back. Here's how to build a winning parent-teacher team: 1. Have face-to-face talks. Set up meetings early in the school year to talk about how ADHD affects your child. It's different for everyone, and your kid's situation is unique. Stay positive. Instead of talking about his problems, focus on what helps him. So avoid saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009c He never listens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Replace that with something like, \u00e2\u0080\u009c I find that Johnny pays more attention when we're in a quiet space and he looks me in the eye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you have any educational reports or plans, like an individualized education program ( IEP), share copies with the teachers. 2. Keep talking. Check in regularly either in person, by email, or phone and ask about your child's behavior and how he's doing with schoolwork. Check teacher websites about upcoming tests or big projects. Ask for the teacher's advice on how best to help your child organize and prepare well ahead of the due dates. This can head off a last-minute meltdown for you and your child. 3. Be tactful. Choose your words carefully so you don't put a teacher on the defensive. Instead of: \u00e2\u0080\u009c Why aren't you helping Johnny finish his class assignments in school?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Try this: \u00e2\u0080\u009c I'm concerned that Johnny needs to finish classwork at home. Is there anything we can do to help him work more quickly at school?\" 4. Don't take things personally. You may get calls saying your child's disrupting class or not paying attention. Don't lash out at the messenger. Instead, say that you know your son often is a handful, and then talk about solutions to the problems. Simple things like changing where he sits or giving him directions one task at a time may help. 5. Keep teachers in the loop. If you start or change ADHD medication, tell the teachers and administrators. They can watch for side effects and let you know if medication seems to be helping. Also, let them know if there's a big change at home -- like a divorce or death -- since these kinds of things can affect any child's behavior. 6. Set shared goals. Many ADHD symptoms affect your child inside and outside school. If following directions is a problem, brainstorm with the teacher about ways to help him stay on track that you can use both at home and in the classroom. Using the same tools creates a link between school and home. 7. Be organized at meetings. Parent-teacher conferences are usually short, so come with a list of questions so you don't forget to ask something important. Organize report cards, test results, and teacher notes in a binder so they're at your fingertips. 8. Don't be a stranger. Attend back-to-school night and volunteer to chaperone a field trip or help in the library. That will show the teacher and your child that you're plugged into the school. And you'll get a first-hand look at how your child interacts there. 9. Say thank you. When a teacher goes the extra mile to understand and help your child, write a simple note showing your appreciation."

        "context": "Cancer treatment can take a lot out of you, both physically and emotionally, so it's common to feel tired. It's important to bring this up with your doctor, but there are also a few steps you can take to keep your fatigue in check. Get moving. You might not feel like moving a muscle, but exercise can actually boost your energy. ( Make sure you get your doctor's OK first.) Try walking, or another moderate activity you enjoy, as often as you can, even if it's only for 15 minutes. Ease your mind. Mind-body workouts like yoga, tai chi, or qi gong (a Chinese form of moving meditation) can reduce fatigue by helping you focus on relaxation. Go easy on yourself. Figure out what needs to be done today, and what you can put on hold. Spread activities throughout your day, and make sure to rest in between. Sleep well. A good night's sleep can help you feel more rested. To help make that happen, don't get into your bed to read or work on your laptop. Turn off music and all screens during bedtime, and limit daytime naps to an hour or less. Right before bed is also a good time for activities that relax you, like meditation or journaling. Talk it out. Anxiety, fear, and hopelessness can add to fatigue as well. A therapist can help you let out some of those feelings. You can also join a support group so you can hear how other people in treatment are handling their exhaustion. Drink enough liquids. Dehydration can make you tired and confused. Keep a bottle of water close and sip often. If you don't like the taste of plain water, try adding sliced lemon, orange, or lime. Soups, gelatin, ice pops, and the water in fruits and vegetables all count, too. Snack throughout the day. You need calories to keep up your strength. If your appetite is off, try eating 5 to 6 small meals throughout the day instead of three big ones. Cut back on sugar. Sugary foods spike your energy, but it wears off quickly. In the end, you're left even more worn out. To keep blood sugar levels stable, try snacking on a mix of protein, fat, and fiber like a piece of fruit with cottage cheese or a handful of walnuts. Eat iron-rich foods. Your body needs iron to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen through your body and give you energy. An iron shortage can lead to anemia, which makes you really tired. Include iron-rich foods like spinach, lentils, beans, fortified cereals, and red meat in your diet. Also focus on foods high in vitamin C, like strawberries and citrus fruit, which help your body absorb iron. But don't take a supplement without first checking with your doctor. She can also test you for anemia and suggest a good way to treat it. Ask for help. Friends and loved ones will want to help you through treatment but may not know what to do. Don't be afraid to make specific requests for cooking meals, running errands, or watching your kids so you can rest. Or ask a friend to organize help for you. Go outside. Whether you sit on the beach, bird watch, or take a walk through a park, simply being outside can help you feel more alert and mentally refreshed. Talk to your doctor. Keep track of what times of day you feel most tired. Does it get worse after treatment? What makes it better? When you share this with your doctor, she may suggest that you try different medication or look for other causes of your fatigue."

You'll drink and drink and drink -- and drink -- and still be thirsty. That's polydipsia. People who have polydipsia will also spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Instead of the 3 quarts most adults will pee out in a day, they can pee out as much as 16 quarts, depending on how much fluid they drink and what's causing their polydipsia. Treatment for it depends on why you have it. You usually get polydipsia as a symptom of other things. Diabetes: Super high blood sugar will make you pee a lot. The more you pee, the more dehydrated and thirstier you get, and the more you drink. Diabetes insipidus: What most people think of when they hear \"diabetes\" has to do with your pancreas. Diabetes insipidus happens when there's a problem with your kidneys or your pituitary gland, which makes a hormone that helps control how much water your kidneys keep in your body. Mental illness: Some people have an uncontrollable urge to drink water, so they drink it all day even though they don't need to. This is called psychogenic polydipsia. Mental illnesses that can cause polydipsia include: Schizophrenia and other personality disorders Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety Anorexia Brain injuries and damage: This could be from diseases like HIV or other illnesses. Drinking too much water can upset the balance of chemistry in your body. Normally you get rid of extra water by peeing, but when your body can't keep up, your blood gets diluted. It could lead to too little sodium in your blood (hyponatremia) with too much water in and around your cells. This condition can damage your organs and bones. It can also cause: Headache Nausea Cramps Slow reflexes Slurred speech Low energy Confusion Seizures As hyponatremia gets worse, you could go into a coma or die. If you've been extremely thirsty for a few days and peeing a lot, and you have any of these other symptoms, call your doctor right away.

        "context": "The most important nutrients for people with osteoporosis are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium is a key building block for your bones. Vitamin D helps your body to absorb calcium. How much should you get? It depends, in part, on your age and gender. For calcium: Children ages 1-3 should get 700 milligrams of calcium a day. Children ages 4-8 should get 1,000 milligrams per day. Children over age 9 and teenagers should get 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day. Women over age 51 and men over age 71 should get 1,200 milligrams per day. All other adults should get 1,000 milligrams per day. For vitamin D: 600 international units ( IU) of vitamin D per day from age 1 through age 70 800 IU daily after age 70. Some osteoporosis experts recommend 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D per day. To find out how much vitamin D you personally need, consider a blood test for the vitamin (25-hydroxy vitamin D) from your doctor. It measures how much vitamin D is in your body. Experts think that vitamin D may do more to protect you from osteoporosis than only helping you absorb calcium. To strengthen bones and prevent osteoporosis, you can get calcium and vitamin D from your diet, supplements, or both. It's best to get these nutrients from food, rather than supplements. Why? Because it's easier to remember. You may not take a pill every day, but you eat every day. Foods also are a more complete source of nutrition than supplements. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products have high levels of calcium, and also other key nutrients for bone health, such as phosphorus and protein. When you read food labels, look for foods and drinks that give you 10% or more of the Daily Value for calcium. If you're lactose intolerant or avoid dairy for other reasons, there are lots of other options: Calcium-fortified orange juice, plant-based milks (like soy and almond milk), and cereals Green, leafy vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and spinach Seafood such as canned salmon, oysters, ocean perch, clams, blue crab, and shrimp For vitamin D, look for items that are fortified, such as some orange juices, breakfast cereals, and plant-based milks. Certain fish, such as salmon, tuna fish, and sardines, may also be a good source. If you can't get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet, talk to your doctor about whether you need supplements. Calcium supplements come in several types, including: Calcium citrate Calcium carbonate As far as your bones are concerned, it doesn't matter which type you take. The difference is in how you take them. You should take calcium carbonate supplements with meals, to help your body absorb the most calcium. If you take calcium citrate instead, you don't need to take them when you eat. With either type, your body can only absorb up to 500 milligrams at one time. So you may need to take supplements more than once a day. Most of these supplements also come in formulas that include a dose of vitamin D. If you get the combination form, you'll get both nutrients in one pill."

You'll get a blood test to check for antibodies to anthrax or toxin made by the anthrax bacteria in your blood. You may also get swabs of your skin or samples of your spinal fluid, stool, or mucus that you cough up. Tell your doctor what happened. If he thinks you may have breathed in the spores that yield anthrax bacteria, you may get a chest X-ray or CT scan. The treatment you need will depend on what happened and how you were exposed. You'll get antibiotics, which you may get through an IV. You may also need an antitoxin, which is a type of medicine that counters the poisons that anthrax bacteria make. Anthrax antitoxins include obiltoxaximab ( Anthim) or raxibacumab ( ABthrax) to help treat inhaled anthrax. If your case is serious, you'll get the treatment in a hospital. There is an anthrax vaccine, but it's only for people who are at risk because they might become exposed to anthrax. This group includes people who work in a lab with anthrax, some people who work with animals or animal products, and some members of the U. S. military. The anthrax vaccine isn't approved for use after exposure, but that might change in an emergency situation, such as if anthrax were used in terrorism. In that case, people who are exposed would need three shots of the vaccine over 4 weeks, and also take antibiotics of 60 days. Remember, anthrax is rare in the United States. You can't get it unless the spores get into your body, either through a cut or because you breathe them in or drink or eat something that's contaminated with spores that contain the bacteria. You cannot catch anthrax from someone else."

        "context": "No matter how good you've been about wearing sunscreen, it's almost impossible not to have soaked up some ultraviolet ( UV) damage along the way. And since the sun causes most skin aging, chances are you're paying the price with wrinkles, brown spots, and sagging skin. But don't worry: Sun damage doesn't have to end your hopes of complexion perfection. Try these remedies to get to a healthy glow. Sunscreen doesn't just protect you from UV rays. It gives skin time to heal and your immune system the chance to repair some sun damage. Choose an SPF 30 sunscreen labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroad-spectrum\u00e2\u0080\u009d -- meaning it guards against the rays that cause wrinkles and brown spots -- and use it every day. When it comes to reversing sun damage, no skin care ingredient is better than retinoids, a form of vitamin A. They do everything from smoothing fine lines and fading dark spots to making pores look smaller. You can start with an over-the-counter form -- look for retinol on the ingredients list. Or ask your doctor for a stronger prescription. Use the product at night since sunlight makes retinoids inactive. They can irritate your skin, so it's best to ease them into your skin care routine. Apply every third night to start, and slowly work up to nightly use. During the day, use a cream with antioxidants like vitamin C, coffeeberry extract, or green tea. They defend against the sun's damage to collagen and elastin, the proteins that keep skin firm and supple, and improve existing signs of aging. The idea that you can sleep away your skin troubles isn't far-fetched. Nighttime is when skin does the bulk of its repair work, such as making new cells and mending or shedding old, damaged ones. This is also when it makes the most of any creams and lotions you apply. Skin gets warmer at night, so products seep in better and yield faster results. Aim to snooze for at least 7 hours a night. In one study, women who slept 7 to 9 hours a night looked younger, had more hydrated skin, and were happier with their looks than those who slept only 5 hours. Nutrition is just as important for your skin as it is for the rest of your body. In one study, people with sun damage who ate more vegetables, olive oil, fish, and legumes -- and less butter, meat, dairy, and sugar -- had fewer wrinkles. The results were similar for women with diets high in vitamin C, like citrus fruits, broccoli, strawberries, and leafy greens. Vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds have another nutrient, a fatty acid called linoleic acid, which moisturizes skin. And since antioxidants offer UV protection from the inside out, foods high in lycopene (tomatoes), polyphenols (green tea), and flavanols (cocoa) can be part of your skin-saving strategy. When you boost your heart rate and blood flow, you help your body undo skin aging by delivering more nutrients to cells that repair damage. A sweat session also makes your skin more taut and toned. Want proof? In a recent study, researchers found that people over 40 who were active for at least 3 hours a week had skin that was similar to that of people in their 20s and 30s -- even in someone up to age 65. As a bonus, exercise also helps you keep a healthy weight, which is key since extra pounds weaken your skin's support structure and lead to sagging. Inner turmoil takes a huge toll on skin. Part of the reason is that stress increases the hormone cortisol. It keeps skin from holding on to water and triggers a spike in blood sugar that damages collagen and elastin. Any type of exercise can tame tension, but yoga seems to be an especially good way to lower cortisol levels. Sure, alcohol has antioxidants that help protect skin from damage. But it's high in sugar, too. When you get too much, it triggers a process called glycation that destroys collagen and elastin. It also saps skin's hydration, which makes wrinkles more noticeable, and causes spidery capillaries to show up on your face. For most people, a daily beer or glass of wine won't have a visible effect on skin."

First, your doctor will carefully check the injury to see where and how bad it is. So expect a physical exam and an X-ray. After that, you may need to get a CT scan, which is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. Your doctor will then suggest a treatment plan. It depends on the location of your break. Your shoulder is made up of three bones, and a fracture usually involves one of them: Shoulder blade (scapula) Collarbone (clavicle) Arm bone (humerus) Here's what to expect with each kind of fracture: Shoulder blade. It's protected by your chest and layers of muscle, so a fracture there isn't that common. But if you do break it, you probably won't need surgery. Instead, your doctor will give you a sling that holds your arm in place and keeps it still while the bone heals. You can also expect a prescription for pain medicine and instructions to apply ice. If the break is in both the shoulder blade and another part of your shoulder, you may need an operation. A surgeon uses plates and screws to put the bones into place and hold them together. Collarbone. It usually heals without surgery. Your doctor may fit you with a sling to hold your arm still. If the bone comes through the skin, or if it's fractured in more than one place, you may need an operation. Just like with shoulder surgery, your doctor will need to hold it together with plates, screws, or pins. Arm bone. It's the area closest to your shoulder. A break there can heal without surgery if the bones haven't shifted apart. You'll need to wear a sling while it heals. If the break is serious, a surgeon will put in pins, plates, and screws. In some cases, you might need a total shoulder replacement. Your shoulder has a lot of work to do in order to heal. First, the bones have to grow back together just right. Then they need to regain their strength. Finally, they must be able to work like they used to. To help your shoulder accomplish all those tasks, your doctor may refer you to a specialist like one of these: Physiatrist, a doctor trained in nerve, muscle, and bone recovery Physical therapist, who uses movement and exercises to help you get your shoulder back to normal Occupational therapist, who helps you do your day-to-day activities as you heal Your risk of breaking a bone is greater after a fracture, so take extra care. Your doctor will go over ways to avoid falls. For instance, he may suggest you: Keep good posture. Avoid risky activities. Do bone-strengthening exercises."

        "context": "Could eating like a caveman help with your rheumatoid arthritis? There isn't a specific diet that's proven to help with RA. But some people say a strict form of the Paleo diet makes their achy joints feel better. It's called the Paleo Autoimmune Protocol or AIP. The idea is to flood your body with nutrient-rich foods and stay away from ones that might make your condition worse. If you're seriously thinking about changing your diet, talk to your doctor first. RA and the medications that treat it can make it hard for you to get the nutrition you need. You don't want to make that worse. The Paleo diet is based on what early humans may have eaten in the Paleolithic era. That's more than 2 million years before modern farming began. In the Stone Age, people ate only what they could hunt or gather. Farming changed that. Once it started nearly10,000 years ago, dairy, grains, and beans became staples in the diet. Paleo \"friendly\" foods include: Eggs Fermented vegetables and fruits Fish and seafood Fruits and veggies (most of your plate should be plant-based) Grass-fed meat (including organ meat) Nuts and seeds Paleo \"unfriendly\" foods include: Dairy products Grains (including corn, wheat, pasta) Refined and processed foods (like sugar, soda, pizza, packaged foods) Legumes (like beans and lentils) Vegetable oils One large study showed that a \" Western\" diet heavy on red and processed meat, refined grains, fried foods, and sugars raised the risk of getting RA. People who ate a diet filled with fruits, veggies, and lean proteins were less likely to have it. But the AIP takes Paleo a step further. It works on the theory that certain foods can bother your gut and cause inflammation (swelling), which also happens with autoimmune diseases like RA. With AIP, you follow the Paleo diet. But you also stop eating the following for a while: Alcohol Eggs Fruit juices and many sweeteners Nightshade veggies (tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes, peppers, tomatillos, etc.) Nuts Seed-based spices (fennel, dill, sesame seeds, and others) Seeds (including cocoa and coffee) If you start feeling better after 3 or 4 weeks, you bring back these foods one at a time. Watch for a reaction for a few days before adding another one to your diet. Stop eating the food if: Your RA comes back or gets worse Your stomach hurts or you have bowel changes, heartburn, or other intestinal distress You're low energy or tired You have headaches or dizziness You have a runny nose You notice skin changes (rashes, acne, etc.) AIP isn't just about food. Your lifestyle choices also matter. Getting the sleep you need, managing stress, exercising, and staying socially active are all important. More research is needed to see if the Paleo diet or the AIP is really a good choice for people who have RA. Because these diets don't include many foods that give you essential elements like fiber, calcium, and certain vitamins, they may not be good for you in the long run. A Mediterranean-style diet may help with your RA because it also fights inflammation. You mainly eat foods from that region such as fish, poultry, unsaturated fats like olive oil, fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Omega-3 fatty acid, mostly found in fish but also in walnuts and green leafy vegetables, can ease inflammation and make swollen painful joints feel better. Adding olive oil to foods rich in omega 3's may be even more helpful, according to some studies. Antioxidant vitamins found mainly in fruits, veggies, and some nuts also may prevent tissue damage. A study from the Netherlands showed that people said they had fewer swollen and painful joints 10 weeks after starting a diet heavy in certain antioxidants. These are the key antioxidants and where you can find them: Vitamin A:green leafy veggies, chicken, turkey, carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes Vitamin C:citrus fruits, plums, Brussels sprouts, red peppers Vitamin E:peanut butter, sunflower seeds and oil, avocados, milk, whole grains Selenium: Brazil nuts, cottage cheese, tuna, beef RA can break down cartilage. That's the flexible tissue in your joints that keeps your bones from rubbing together. Certain nutrients can help repair and protect it: Vitamin B5:potatoes, beans, bananas, turkey, fish, and liver Vitamin B6:chickpeas, chicken, pork, trout, sunflower seeds, spinach, tomatoes Copper: oysters, squid, and other seafood; beef liver; cashews and other nuts; soybeans; lentils; cocoa Zinc: lobster, chicken, beans, raisins, chickpeas, yogurt, cheese Some chemicals found in plants called flavonoids may help make your joints feel better. Apples, green and white tea, grapes, and red wine are rich in them."

        "context": "Medicine can get into your body in a few different ways. You can swallow a pill, drink a liquid, or get a shot. A suppository is another way to deliver a drug. It's a small, round or cone-shaped object that you put in your body, often into your bottom. Once it's inside, it melts or dissolves and releases its medication. Suppositories may not be the most pleasant product you'll ever use. But they can make it easier to take medicine that you can't swallow or that your stomach or intestines wouldn't absorb well. Suppositories have a base made from substances like gelatin or cocoa butter that surrounds the drug. As the warmth of your body melts the outside, the drug slowly releases. Different types of suppositories go into the rectum, vagina, or the duct that empties your bladder, called the urethra. Sometimes they treat the area where you put them in. Or the medicine absorbs into your blood and travels to other parts of your body. Rectal suppositories go in your bottom. They are about an inch long and have a rounded or bullet-shaped tip. You might take them to treat: Allergies Anxiety Asthma Constipation Fever Hemorrhoids Motion sickness Nausea Pain and itching Mental health problems, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder Vaginal suppositories are oval-shaped. You can use them for: Bacterial or fungal infections Vaginal dryness Birth control Urethral suppositories are rare. There's only one kind, MUSE, which men with erection problems can use to take the drug alprostadil. The suppository is about the size of a grain of rice. You might need a suppository if: The drug you're taking would break down too quickly in your digestive tract if you took it as a pill or liquid. You can't swallow medicine. You're vomiting and can't keep a pill or liquid down. The medicine tastes too bad to take by mouth. To put in a rectal suppository: Go to the bathroom first to try to empty your colon. Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Unwrap the suppository. Rub a water-based lubricant over the tip or dip it in water. It will help you slide it in smoothly. Get in a comfortable position. You can stand with one leg up on a chair or lie on your side with one leg straight and the other bent in toward your stomach. Gently spread your buttocks open. Carefully push the suppository, tapered end first, about 1 inch into your bottom. Close your legs and sit or lie still for about 15 minutes to let it dissolve. Wash your hands again with warm water and soap. To put a suppository into your vagina: Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Unwrap the suppository and put it into the applicator. Lie on your back with your knees bent toward your chest, or stand with your knees bent and your feet a few inches apart. Gently put the applicator into your vagina as far is it will go without feeling uncomfortable. Press on the plunger at the end of the applicator to push the suppository in, then remove the applicator. Lie down for a few minutes to let the medicine absorb. Wash your hands again with soap and warm water. Vaginal suppositories can be messy, so you may want to wear a pad for a little while after you put one in. To put in a urethral suppository: Go to the bathroom to empty your bladder. Remove the cover from the applicator. Stretch your penis to its full length to open the urethra, and put the applicator into the hole at the tip. Gently push the button at the top of the applicator until it stops. Hold it there for 5 seconds. Sway the applicator from side to side to make sure the suppository has gone in. Pull out the applicator. Make sure there's no more medicine in it. While your penis is still pulled out, massage it firmly between your hands for at least 10 seconds to help the medicine absorb. Suppositories are usually safe. Yet there can be some problems when you take medicine this way: Some of the medicine might leak back out. Sometimes your body doesn't absorb the drug as well as if you took it by mouth. The medicine can irritate the spot where you put it in. Ask your doctor before you use a suppository if you: Have an irregular heartbeat Have had recent surgery on your rectum Are a man who's had prostate surgery recently Are a woman who's had surgery or radiation treatment to your vaginal area"

        "context": "Abdominal migraines aren't headaches. As their name suggests, they make your belly ache instead. But they often happen as a reaction to the same triggers as migraine headaches. They can hurt a lot and cause nausea, cramps, and often vomiting. Kids whose family members get migraines are more likely to get abdominal migraines. Of all kids who have chronic stomach pain, up to 15% of them may have abdominal migraines. ; they're rare in adults. More girls get them than boys. And kids who have abdominal migraines typically get migraine headaches when they get older. We don't know their exact cause. One theory is that changes in the levels of two compounds your body makes, histamine and serotonin, are responsible. Experts think that being upset or worried can affect them. Foods such as chocolate, Chinese food with monosodium glutamate ( MSG), and processed meats with nitrites might trigger abdominal migraines in some people. Swallowing a lot of air may also trigger them or set off similar tummy symptoms. It can cause bloating and trouble eating. It will hurt in the center of your child's body or around their belly button (not their sides), what doctors call midline abdominal pain. Your little one could also: Feel queasy or throw up Be pale or flushed Yawn, be drowsy, or have little energy Lose their appetite or be unable to eat Have dark shadows under their eyes Abdominal migraines are often sudden and quite severe. They can hit without any warning signs. The pain may go away after an hour, or it may last as long as 3 days. It can be hard to diagnose them because kids have trouble telling the difference between an abdominal migraine and ordinary stomachaches, stomach flu, or other problems with their belly and guts. Because abdominal migraines tend to run in families, the doctor will ask about relatives who have migraine headaches. Then he'll try to rule out other causes for stomach pain. And he'll see how closely your child's symptoms match a specific list that migraine experts have come up with. Sometimes, simply knowing what the problem is makes it easier to deal with. Because we don't know much about abdominal migraines, doctors may treat them like other migraines. But they usually don't prescribe drugs unless the symptoms are very bad or happen a lot. Medications like rizatriptan ( Maxalt) and sumatriptan ( Imitrex), called triptans, haven't been approved for children, though older kids may have luck taking sumatriptan as a nasal spray. With their parents' and doctor's help, kids with abdominal migraines may be able to figure out what triggers them. Keep a diary: Note the date and time they get it, what foods they had eaten earlier, what they were doing before it happened, if they took any medication recently, and if there's anything going on in their lives that could be making them stressed or anxious. If a food triggers abdominal migraines, they can try to avoid eating it. But that may not work for everyone. Some drugs may lessen how severe episodes are or how often a child gets them. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine that also helps tummy troubles Propranolol ( Inderal), a kind of heart medication called a beta-blocker Valproic acid ( Depakene, Depakote), a medicine for seizures and bipolar disorder Kids who have abdominal migraines should eat a nutritious diet with plenty of fiber. Other healthy habits, like daily exercise and getting enough sleep, and teaching them how to manage their emotions and deal with problems, can help, too."

Its main job is to help your body fight off disease and stay healthy. Immunotherapy drugs help your immune system work harder or make it easier for it to find and get rid of cancer cells. Several immunotherapy drugs have been approved to fight cancer, and hundreds more are being tested in clinical trials (research studies that use volunteers to test new medicines). If immunotherapy seems like the best way to fight your cancer, your doctor may know of a clinical trial you can join. If your doctor suggests immunotherapy to fight your cancer, there's a lot to talk to them about before you decide if it's right for you. There are many reasons your doctor might think immunotherapy is a good choice for you: Immunotherapy may work when other treatments don't. Some cancers (like skin cancer) don't respond well to radiation or chemotherapy but start to go away after immunotherapy. It can help other cancer treatments work better. Other therapies you have, like chemotherapy, may work better if you also have immunotherapy. It causes fewer side effects than other treatments. This is because it targets just your immune system and not all the cells in your body. Your cancer may be less likely to return. When you have immunotherapy, your immune system learns to go after cancer cells if they ever come back. This is called immunomemory, and it could help you stay cancer-free for a longer time. Immunotherapy holds a lot of promise as a cancer treatment. Still, it can cause some problems. You might have a bad reaction. The area where the medication goes into your body could hurt, itch, swell, turn red, or get sore. There are side effects. Some types of immunotherapy rev up your immune system and make you feel like you have the flu, complete with fever, chills, and fatigue. Others could cause problems like swelling, weight gain from extra fluids, heart palpitations, a stuffy head, and diarrhea. Most of the time, these ease up after your first treatment. It can harm organs and systems. Some of these drugs can cause your immune system to attack organs like your heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, or intestines. It isn't a quick fix. In some cases, immunotherapy takes longer to work than other treatments. Your cancer may not go away quickly. It doesn't work for everyone. Right now, immunotherapy works for less than half the people who try it. Many people only have a partial response. This means your tumor could stop growing or get smaller, but it doesn't go away. Doctors aren't sure yet why immunotherapy helps only some people. Your body could get used to it. Over time, immunotherapy may stop having an effect on your cancer cells. This means that even if it works at first, your tumor could start to grow again."

        "context": "Could diet be to blame for your child's eczema? It's possible. Up to 1 in 3 kids with eczema has a food allergy that could make symptoms worse. If you remove some choices, it could make a big difference. But since finding food triggers is tricky -- and eczema can have lots of other causes -- don't jump to conclusions. Work closely with an allergist. When you have a food allergy, your body reacts to a harmless treat as if it's a dangerous germ and attacks. Symptoms -- like swelling -- are side effects of your body's defenses. Eczema doesn't seem to be an allergic condition, but reactions from food can make it worse in some kids. It's more likely in babies and young children. Some foods are more likely to bring symptoms. The common offenders are: Milk Eggs Peanuts Tree nuts Wheat Fish Shellfish Soy While trigger foods can make eczema worse, experts don't think they're really the original cause. Instead, it seems to result from \"leakiness\" in the outer layer of skin that lets in irritants, germs, and allergens. Some are obvious. If your child eats lobster for the first time and breaks out in hives 15 minutes later, it's probably not hard to figure out. But with eczema, it's often tougher. Symptoms may not show up for days after you eat something. If you do find a trigger food and get rid of it, that may help. Still, it may not make the eczema go away. Remember, 2 out of 3 kids with eczema don't have a food allergy at all. That's why working with a doctor is so important. He can guide you toward the real cause through tests like: Elimination diets. If your doctor thinks a food may be harmful, he may ask you not to give it to your kid for 10 to 14 days. Watch to see if it makes a difference. Food challenges. After you've taken a food out of your child's diet, your pediatrician might want you to add a small amount back in to see if it causes symptoms. He may want to do this in the office, just in case your child has a reaction. Skin testing. A doctor can take an extract of the food and use it to scratch the skin lightly. If the area swells up, that could be an allergic reaction. However, it's not always accurate. Blood tests. RAST -- a radioallergosorbent test -- can check for special cells in the blood that signal specific food allergies. Again, it's not always accurate. Other lab tests can check for cells that trigger swelling. Tracking down a food trigger can take patience and detective work. Be methodical. Only eliminate one food at a time. If you ban dairy and gluten at the same time and symptoms get better, you won't know which one made the difference. Use a food diary to keep track of what you get rid of, and the changes that brings. Move slowly. A positive skin test isn't reason enough to cut out a food. Lots of kids test positive for foods that don't really cause symptoms. Plus, if you get rid of too many foods, you could cut out nutrients your child needs to grow and develop. So for his sake and yours, be sure before you take a food from your child's diet permanently. Work with your doctor. Keep using other treatments. Even if you find a trigger food, getting rid of it may not make the rash disappear. Stick with the other things your doctor recommends -- like skin ointments, lotions, and medicines. Continue to steer clear other allergens like dust mites, pollen, or pet dander, too."

        "context": "What can you do to feel better when you're stiff, sore, and tired? Give exercise a try. It might sound crazy at first, but a workout can boost your energy and make you more flexible. Once you take the first steps, you'll be on your way to reaping the benefits. You, and your joints, will be glad you did. Activity helps to cut the swelling and pain in your joints, and it strengthens your muscles. Exercise, especially the weight-bearing kind, like walking, makes your bones stronger and helps prevent osteoporosis. Many women get weaker bones after menopause, but it's more common for those who have RA and take steroids to treat inflammation. Aerobic exercise, the kind that makes your heart pump faster, can help you control your weight. It also helps protect against heart disease, another condition you're more likely to get if you have RA. Moving around also leads to a better night's sleep. That helps you manage the stress and depression that can come with rheumatoid arthritis. You know that you should exercise, but what makes you get up and do it? These tips can lead to success: Start slowly. Set a goal: Maybe you want to lose a few pounds, get in better shape for a trip, or walk a 5 K. Set small targets that will get you to your larger goal. Chart your progress. Reward yourself when you meet each milestone. Get off to a good start with this strategy: Talk to your doctor. Ask what kind of exercise is best for you. He'll let you know if there are activities you should skip. For instance, if you have inflammation in your shoulder, you may want to bike or walk instead of swim. Keep it real. If you don't know where to begin or feel you don't have much time to exercise, start with 5 minutes. The next day, try to do a minute more, and so on. But if you're raring to go, be careful not to overdo it at first. It's less important where you start than where you end up. Make it easy. If it's a hassle to get to a gym, work out at home or in your neighborhood. But if you like the energy of a fitness center, try to find one that isn't off your beaten path. You're more likely to stop in if you pass it every day. Get help to get going. If you can, get advice from a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or a trainer who has experience with arthritis. They can teach you how to gauge your body's response so you don't overdo it, end up in pain, and get discouraged. The simple answer: the one you'll actually do. So pick something you like or would like to try, as long as it doesn't bother your joints. An ideal program has three types of exercise: Aerobics with low to medium impact on your joints. Swimming, biking, walking, dance, and warm-water exercise are all good choices. An elliptical machine can build stamina and energy. Strength training. Lift light weights (1-2 pounds) or use a resistance band to build or maintain muscle mass and strength to keep your joints stable. Flexibility exercises. A workout that moves your joints and stretches your muscles can ease your stiffness and help you avoid injuries. Whatever activity you do, warm up first and stretch afterward. If you're new to exercise, start out with a warm-water aerobics class. The water can soothe sore joints. It's important to be consistent. Build up to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day, five times a week. You can break it down into three 10-minute sessions a day if that's easier. Do flexibility exercises every day. Follow them with strengthening exercises every other day. It's OK to rest if you have joint pain or get tired. Avoid moves that call for fast or repeated movements that hurt your joints. Walking is one of the easiest exercises to do -- all you need is a pair of supportive shoes. If you're wondering how to get started, check out the Arthritis Foundation's Walking Workout. It has weekly timelines for beginning, intermediate, and advanced walkers. Get details on the Arthritis Foundation website. A workout in a group or with friends can help you stay motivated when your get-up-and-go wants to go on strike. A class can help you make some new friends who understand what you're going through. Through its local chapters, the Arthritis Foundation offers an exercise program for people with arthritis. The best thing you can do is listen to your body. If you don't feel well enough to bump up your walking pace or distance one week, stick with the pace from the week before. If you don't feel your best, change the activity. If your joints are swollen or painful, take a day off. Or choose a move that you can manage. The important thing is to keep moving."

        "context": "Lyme disease can be tricky to diagnose. The signs and symptoms can look like many other health problems. The ticks that spread it can pass other diseases on to you at the same time. Plus, the tests that check for it aren't exact. Because of this, you could be told you have Lyme disease when you don't. This bacterial infection is spread through the bite of a young deer tick or black-legged tick. These eight-legged creatures, about the size of a poppy seed, can be found in wooded and grassy areas throughout the United States, especially in New England and the Rocky Mountains. Because these ticks are so small, most people don't realize when they're bitten. But the longer a tick stays attached to you, the more likely it is to transmit Borrelia burgdorferi (the bacteria that causes Lyme disease), if the tick is a carrier. If not found and treated, Lyme disease can lead to problems with your joints, heart, and nervous system. It can even affect your memory. If you've been outside in an area where ticks are known to live, you should tell your doctor. She'll also want to know about the symptoms you're having. These details are crucial to making a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Early symptoms that usually occur within the first month after a tick bite can include: Rash at the site of the tick bite that may look like a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbull's-eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d Headaches Fever Muscle aches Fatigue Symptoms that show up in the weeks to months after a tick bite include: Dizziness Nerve pain Shortness of breath Additional rashes on other parts of the body Facial palsy ( Drooping or loss of muscle tone in your face) Tingling in the hands and feet Severe joint pain or swelling Racing heart Problems with your short-term memory Symptoms that come and go are common with Lyme disease. They will also depend on the stage of the disease. If your doctor suspects that you have Lyme disease, she may order two blood tests. These will look for signs that your body is trying to fight it off. The results are most precise a few weeks after you've been infected. These tests are: ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. This test can't check for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. It can only look for your immune system's response to it. Once Borrelia burgdorferi gets into your blood, your body begins to make special proteins called antibodies to fight it off. The ELISA test checks for those antibodies. Although it's the most common way to check for Lyme disease, the ELISA test isn't perfect. It can sometimes give false \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositive\u00e2\u0080\u009d results. On the other hand, if you have it done too soon after you've been infected, your body may not have developed enough antibodies for the test to detect them. This will give you a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative\u00e2\u0080\u009d result even though you do have Lyme disease. Western blot test. Whether your ELISA test comes back positive or negative, your doctor will need to do this blood test, too. A Western blot uses electricity to split certain proteins in your blood into patterns. This is then compared to the pattern of people known to have Lyme disease. At least five band matches means that you have Lyme disease. Still, not all labs have the same standards. There's a chance that you could get a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositive\u00e2\u0080\u009d result from one and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative\u00e2\u0080\u009d result from another. Also, some labs offer a test for Lyme disease using your urine or other body fluids. These methods aren't approved by the FDA. Studies also show that the results often aren't correct. You may be told that you have Lyme disease when you don't. Other tests: Lyme disease is called \u00e2\u0080\u009c The Great Imitator\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it mimics so many different health conditions. Your doctor may also want to do more blood or imaging tests to rule out: Alzheimer's disease Arthritis Attention deficit disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Fibromyalgia Guillain- Barre syndrome Lou Gehrig's disease ( ALS) Lupus Mononucleosis Multiple sclerosis Parkinson's disease If you think you have Lyme disease, it's a good idea to see a board-certified infectious disease specialist. This type of doctor is skilled in both diagnosis and treatment. The tests that look for Lyme disease aren't foolproof, so your doctor may decide to start you on treatment based on your symptoms and the likelihood you've been exposed to ticks. Ideally, the diagnosis will be confirmed for treatment to continue."
